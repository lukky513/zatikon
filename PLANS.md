# Plans for the future releases

- re-enable password recovery
- make tutorial skippable
- headless mode (for tests)
- better AI
- more units
- pause, at least for standalone
  - save and resume?
- protobuf or other (backwards compatible) serialization for:
  - player state in DB
  - network protocol
- enforce migration path for the saved DB state
- restore the ability to use MySQL/Postgres/other for state separation
- better utils for debug/cheats
- balance
  - counter for inorganic
  - unit cost
- customizability
  - board size
  - limits: commands, army size, turn length, etc.
  - introduce as "custom game" button?
- fix the unit cost function not to use a loop
- keyboard controls
- controller support
- change the GUI to be more portable
- make GUI resizable, or otherwise fill the screen space
- tileset support
- available on stores
- add server config
  - allow changing the bind address
  - allow changing the ports the game is running on (maybe reduce it to a single one)
- untangle the object instances representing the client and server side, so that it's possible to run server as a thread set rather than a separate process
- go through all the code warnings and fix what's viable to fix
- review the patterns used by the code in order to plan further refactors
- port to more platforms, in particular web
- update buttons in the main UI (refer friend, etc.)
- spectator mode
- unit tiers to reduce complexity
- AI limitations, especially on lower levels; exhaustion of points, command limits, slowly replace with better logic
- undo for moves
- tool for managing the users
